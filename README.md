# Blog Project - Mobile App
This is my school project, that is part of the "Mobile Computing" course from the third year of study at the HFTM in Grenchen.
The goal is to build up a nice and compelling looking mobile app that acts as a frontend to the Java backend project.

You can find the corresponding java backend here:
